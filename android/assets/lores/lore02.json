  description: "Age 2 - SP City\n\n  The fall was quick. After the Capybaras killed most of the students and employees, police barricaded the University’s gates, and when the army came, they brought many guns and opened the gates hoping to eradicate the remaining Capybara, but found the University empty, the Capybaras had digged holes and disappeared through them. They emerged from multiple spots in the city that same day, and attacked. The army wasn’t enough to hold them, and thousands of people died that day. The Capybaras offered to spare the lives of all that surrendered, to be their loyal and well-treated servants, and all seemed to be going well until the army brought backup and broke the peace treaty the mayor had done with Hobertus, the Bold, the leading Capybara at that time. For their betrayal, Hobertus decided to raze the city, burning everything and killing every human.",
