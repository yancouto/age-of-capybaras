  "description": "Age 2 - SP City\n\n  The fall was quick. After the death of most of the students and employees, the police barricaded the University's gates, awaiting the army's arrival.\n  With their approach, many weapons were brought in hopes of eradicating the Capybara, but upon the gate's opening, they found the University empty, the Capybaras had digged holes and disappeared through them.\n\n  They emerged from multiple spots throughout the city during that same day and attacked, leading to the death of thousands. The army wasn't quick enough to react.\n  The Capybaras offered to spare the lives of all those who surrendered, making them their servants. All seemed to be going well for the Capybaras until the army collected all their forces and attempted, to no avail, to end their rule.\n\n  This act broke the non-aggression pact made between the city's government and Hobertus, the Bold, the leading Capybara at that time.\n  For their treachery, Hobertus decided to raze the city, burning everything and killing every human.",
