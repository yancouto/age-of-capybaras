  "description": "Age 1 - USP's Olympic Streak\n\n  In recent years, USP (University of South Patrick) students were trying to develop a way to increase the number of Capybara on the Universityâ€™s Olympic Streak in order to lower the price of food in the nearby cafeteria.\n  This initial effort lead to a secret research, held by the government inside the university's grounds, to develop a substance called XL Sior, whose true goal is still unknown to this day.\n\n  During a college party, some drunken engineering students managed to sneak into the government facility and steal XL Sior, still in its experimental phase, fascinated by its texture and natural yellow glow. In a dare, one of the students drank it, but his weak, human body couldn't handle it, so he died.\n  Frightened, the other students dumped his body on the Olympic Streak's waters, hoping it wouldn't come to haunt them later. They were wrong.\n\n  Even though the human body wasn't strong enough to survive XL Sior, the Capybaras' body could not only bear it, but also harness it's power. The effect went unnoticed for a couple weeks, but when they manifested themselves, everything changed.",
