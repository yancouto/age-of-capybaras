  description: "Age 1 - USP's Olympic Streak\n\n  In recent years, USP (University of South Patrick) students were trying to develop a new mechanism that would increase the number of Capybara on the University’s Olympic Streak in order to lower the price of food in the nearby cafeteria.\n  At the same time, a secret research was being held by the government, developing a substance called Element X, whose objectives are still not known up to this day.\n  During a college party, some drunken engineering students managed to break into the government lab and steal Element X, amazed by its colors and natural yellow glow. In a dare, one of the students drank it, and his weak body couldn’t handle it, so he died.\n  The other students got scared and dumped his body on the water, hoping it wouldn’t come to haunt them later. They were wrong.\n  Even though the human body wasn’t strong enough to survive Element X, capybaras’ body reacted in a very different way. The effect couldn’t be seem for a couple weeks, but when the Capybaras emerged, everything had changed.",
