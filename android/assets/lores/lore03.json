  "description": "Age 3 - World Domination\n\n  During Hobertus's reign, the Capybara spread through whole country, but couldn't move past its borders, since a planetary effort was made to create a huge army to hold back the Capybaras' advance.\n  Hobertus was known to fight with his soldiers where the battle was the thickest, and that habit was his fall.\n\n  Upon Hobertus's death, his daughter, Amelia, took his place. She was said to be gentle, kind, and made treaties with the humans, allowing years of peace.\n  After a few years, a huge caravan of capybaras was organized with the alleged purpose of travelling around the world under a peace banner and asserting the world leaders Amelia only wanted peace.\n\n  During a global meeting in Hydrochanopolis, the new Capybara Capital, she murdered all world leaders who attended and unleashed a worldwide attack she had planned for years. Due to the humans' confusion and lack of preparation, the Capybaras managed to break most countries' defenses in a few months, and the rest fell during the next few years.\n  For this episode, she was know as Amelia, the Deceiver, or Amelia, the Wicked.\n\n  Her last years were troubled times. After the war ended, Amelia became more and more cruel, taking the life of criminals, traitors or anyone who defied her. With her death, no successors was left to continue her rule, so a council was made and a president was elected.\n\n  Carlos, a prestigious scientist, was chosen and ruled for decades. He unmade most of Amelia's brutal laws and encouraged discussion and research, thus improving the Capybaras' culture and technology remarkably during his term.\n\n  It was a time of peace and opulence.",
